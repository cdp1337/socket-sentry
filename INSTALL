INSTALLING SOCKET SENTRY FROM SOURCES
=====================================

IMPORTANT: If you are upgrading to a new version of Socket Sentry, you must
========== uninstall the old version first. Follow the uninstallation
           instructions at the end of this document before continuing.

Socket Sentry is made up of three parts.

socketsentry-service: 
    A D-Bus service that runs as root to collect network and process data.
socketsentry-plasma-engine: 
    Plasma data engine that is really just a thin wrapper around the service.
socketsentry-plasma-widget: 
    The actual UI widget.

To build all three parts, make sure you have the prerequisites.

- Linux kernel >= 2.6
- CMake >= 2.6
- GCC and make
- Qt >= 4.5 development files and headers
- KDE 4.x development files and headers
- libpcap >= 1.0 with headers
- (optional) Google Mock and Google Test >= 1.4

Kubuntu 9.10 or later users can run this to get the required packages:
  sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libqt4-dev libpcap-dev kde-devel

openSUSE 11.2 or later users can run this to get the required packages:
  zypper install cmake libqt4-devel libpcap-devel

Sadly, neither distribution packages GMock/GTest. You can download and install
them manually or skip them if you don't care about running the unit tests.
The build process degrades gracefully if they're not found.

Once you have the required libraries, you can build and install with:
  cd <socketsentry_dir>
  ./install.sh

The script will escalate your privileges to root (using "sudo") to complete the
installation. If that makes you nervous, you can do each step manually. Just
take a look at what "install.sh" does and do the same thing at the console.    

IMPORTANT: The last step of the installation is to restart your Plasma desktop
session. You will very likely get an error if you try to use the widget before
doing this. To restart Plasma, you can log out and then log back in. Or at the
console, type:
  kquitapp plasma-desktop
  plasma-desktop 

INSTALLING SOCKET SENTRY FROM PACKAGES
======================================

IMPORTANT: If you are upgrading to a new version of Socket Sentry, you must
========== uninstall the old version first. Follow the uninstallation
           instructions at the end of this document before continuing.

Binary installation packages for certain Linux distributions are available at
the project web site. You can also build them yourself from sources. The
procedure is roughly the same as above, except you run an appropriate
"./package-<distro>.sh" script instead of the generic "./install.sh" script,
replacing <distro> with your distro name (e.g. "package-ubuntu.sh" for Kubuntu).
Please note that building a package for a different distribution than the one
you're currently running is not supported at this time. Also note that the
generated packages are not "official" packages maintained by the distro
develoeprs. If your distro provides its own packages, you should use those
instead unless you want the absolute latest code.

If you have trouble running the "./package-<distro>.sh" script after having
run a normal build first, please delete the contents of the "build" subdirectory
and try again.

The package files (*.deb or *.rpm) are placed in the "build" subdirectory and
can be installed through your package manager.

IMPORTANT: The last step of the installation is to restart your Plasma desktop
session. You will very likely get an error if you try to use the widget before
doing this. To restart Plasma, you can log out and then log back in. Or at the
console, type:
  kquitapp plasma-desktop
  plasma-desktop 

TESTING THE INSTALLATION
========================

To test the D-Bus service, run the following command (as non-root):
  socksent-client
  
This should print a list of supported network devices. You can call it again
passing in a device name if you want to try it out. Press CTRL-C to end.

If instead you get a cryptic error that says something like "Launch helper
exited with unknown return code", it usually means you're not logged into the
local console or D-Bus can't tell that you are. In either case, you need to
give yourself explcit permission to access the D-Bus service. To do this,
create a group called "socketsentry" and add your user account to it.

Once you've verified that the D-bus service works and you've restarted Plasma
as described in the installation instructions, you should be able to add the 
Socket Sentry Plasma widget to your desktop. 

UNINSTALLING SOCKET SENTRY
==========================

To remove Socket Sentry or before upgrading, follow these steps:

1) Remove all Socket Sentry widgets from desktops and panels.

2) a) If you installed directly from sources, run these commands as root:
        pkill -f socksent-service
        cd <socketsentry_dir>/build
        make uninstall
   b) If you installed from a package, remove it via your package manager.
   
3) (optional) You may remove the [socksent-plasma-widget] global section from
   the "~/.kde/share/config/plasma-desktop-appletsrc" file if you wish. This
   is not required to upgrade.
