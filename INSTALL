INSTALLING SOCKET SENTRY FROM SOURCES
=====================================

IMPORTANT: If you are upgrading to a new version of Socket Sentry, you must
========== uninstall the old version first. Follow the uninstallation
           instructions at the end of this document before continuing.

Socket Sentry is made up of three parts.

socketsentry-service: 
    A D-Bus service that runs as root to collect network and process data.
socketsentry-plasma-engine: 
    Plasma data engine that is really just a thin wrapper around the service.
socketsentry-plasma-widget: 
    The actual UI widget.

To build all three parts, make sure you have the prerequisites.

- Linux kernel >= 2.6
- CMake >= 2.6
- GCC and make
- Qt >= 4.5 development files and headers
- KDE 4.x development files and headers
- libpcap >= 1.0 with headers
- (optional) Google Mock and Google Test >= 1.4

Kubuntu users can run this to get the required packages:
  sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libqt4-dev libpcap-dev kde-devel

openSUSE users can run this to get the required packages:
  zypper install cmake libqt4-devel libpcap-devel

Sadly, neither distribution packages GMock/GTest. You can download and install
them manually or skip them if you don't care about running the unit tests.
The build process degrades gracefully if they're not found.

Once you have the required libraries, you can build and install with:
  cd <socketsentry_dir>
  ./install.sh

The script will escalate your privileges to root (using "sudo") to complete the
installation. If that makes you nervous, you can do each step manually. Just
take a look at what "install.sh" does and do the same thing at the console.    

TESTING THE INSTALLATION
========================

To test the D-Bus service, run the following command (as non-root):
  socksent-client
  
This should print a list of supported network devices. You can call it again
passing in a device name if you want to try it out. Press CTRL-C to end.

If, instead, you get a cryptic error that says something like "Launch helper
exited with unknown return code 254", it usually means you're not logged into
the local console or D-Bus can't tell that you are. In either case, you need to
give yourself explcit permission to access the D-Bus service. To do this,
create a group called "socketsentry" and add your user account to it.

Once you verified that the D-bus service works, you should be able to add the 
Socket Sentry Plasma widget to your desktop. If not, try restarting KDE.

Stir and enjoy!

UNINSTALLING SOCKET SENTRY FROM SOURCES
=======================================

To remove Socket Sentry or before upgrading to a new build, follow these steps:

1) Remove all Socket Sentry widgets from desktops and panels.

2) At a shell prompt, run these commands as root: 
   pkill -f socksent-service
   cd <socketsentry_dir>/build
   make uninstall
   
3) (optional) You may remove the [socksent-plasma-widget] global section from
   the "~/.kde/share/config/plasma-desktop-appletsrc" file if you wish, but this
   is not required to upgrade.
