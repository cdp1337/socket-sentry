TODO:
* Test failure modes: D-Bus service won't start, selected device not found, device list can't be gotten
* D-Bus did not pick up installation configuration change on my work desktop. Had to reboot. Can daemon be reinitialized?
* Debug output in service.
* Test CPU of row aggregation vs. drawing table and update existing FAQ entry.
