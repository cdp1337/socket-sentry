	Socket Sentry - A real-time network traffic monitor for KDE Plasma.

Overview

	A KDE Plasma widget that displays real-time traffic information for 
	active network connections on your Linux computer. It shows you which
	processes are communicating with which hosts, current data transfer 
	rates, protocols, and more. You can view all connections or see
	summary traffic by host pair and process or program. It supports IPv4
	and 6, optional host name lookups with configurable subdomain depth,
	and many sorting and filtering options including pcap filter expressions.
